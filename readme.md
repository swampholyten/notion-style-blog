# Next.js Notion Cloudflare Kit

> An enhanced starter kit for building websites with Next.js and Notion, now optimized for Cloudflare Pages and additional features.

## Intro

This repo is a customized version of the [Next.js Notion Starter Kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit). It has been adapted to work seamlessly with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and includes additional features, such as:

- **Utterances Integration** for blog comments
- **Extended configuration options**
- **Enhanced deployment compatibility**

It still uses Notion as a CMS via [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x), along with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). For deployments, this version is now optimized for Cloudflare Pages but remains compatible with Vercel.

## Features

- Quick setup with a single configuration file ([`site.config.ts`](./site.config.ts))
- Full support for Notion content via [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x)
- Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and React
- Optimized for Cloudflare Pages and Vercel
- Excellent performance and page speeds
- Automatic pretty URLs
- Smooth image previews
- Automatic social images
- Table of contents for long articles
- Dark mode support
- **Comment support with Utterances**
- Responsive design for different devices
